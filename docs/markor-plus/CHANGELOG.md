# Markor Plus — Changelog

This is the changelog for the **Markor Plus** module (separate from the upstream Markor app).  
Format inspired by Keep a Changelog. Semantic versioning is pre-1.0.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- (Planned) Configurable threshold for “long-title” detection (default 120 chars).
- (Planned) Option for color-blind-friendly icon indicator.
### Changed
- (Planned) Replace stock `CalendarView` with a more customizable third-party calendar.
### Fixed
- (Pending) Minor Folder Tree polish and accessibility tweaks.

## [1.2.6] — 2025-08-30
### Added
- **Doc icon badges for long-title notes (>120 chars):**  
  - ○ hollow dot on emoji doc = title-only (no body).  
  - ● filled **red** dot on emoji doc = has body content.
- README and module changelog documenting the Calendar Input + Folder Tree flows.

### Changed
- Date-stamp emphasized at the top of new notes (non-US style).

### Fixed
- Creation-time chronology preserved: editing a note no longer bumps its position.

### Performance
- Image-import optimization groundwork (candidate for separate upstream PR; benchmarks to follow).

### Known limitations
- Rename/move/copy is handled via Markor’s native browser.
- Very large archives may still impact scanning; `.nomedia` or `.skip-scan` can mitigate.
- Root paths vary across devices; no automated migration yet.
- Accessibility/i18n and small-screen polish ongoing.
- **CalendarView quirk:** browsing to other months in the Folder Tree reflects correctly **only after a day is selected** in the calendar (stock `CalendarView` limitation). Future updates will evaluate third-party calendars to remove this quirk.
